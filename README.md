#CATCH ME IF U CAN 



THIS IS A SIMPLE GAME CODED WHILE I WAS LEARNING JQUERY MOBILE. IT MAY BE OF GOOD USE FOR BEGINNERS.

ANYBODY WILLING TO IMPROVE THIS AND ADD ENHANCEMENTS ARE FREE TO DO IT.

###RULES:

```shell
> THERE ARE TWO CRABS YELLOW AND RED CONTINUOUSLY RUNNING. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO CATCH THE
  YELLOW CRAB BY CLICKING ON AND IF INCASE YOU CLICK ON THE RED CRAB WHICH IS DANGEROUS YOU ARE 
  OUT OF THE GAME
  
> THE TIME GIVEN TO CATCH THE CRAB IS 1 MINUTE.

> IF YOU FAIL TO CATCH IT YOU CAN TRY AGAIN BY CLICKING ON THE LINK GIVEN AFTER 1 MINUTE.
```
